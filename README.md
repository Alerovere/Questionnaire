# Questionnaire
A simple python script to create a multi-choice questionnaire with random questions from a spreadsheet 

I created this script to be able to quickly generate exams for my classes. The input needed is a spreadsheet with questions organised by lectures, one correct answer and three uncorrect ones. A sample spreadsheet is provided.

The script (inserted in a jupyter notebook)
